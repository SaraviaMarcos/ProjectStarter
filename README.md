# ProjectStarter
Creates empty html/css/js files inside a new folder in order to start a new project; executable with a terminal (VSCode/Node.JS)

This is just my first script with NodeJS applying 2 processes; mkdirSync & writeFileSync

Later on I will see how can I improve it by linking them one to each other
